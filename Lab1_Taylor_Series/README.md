### Program Description
This program allows the user to input a value for x and a limit (the maximum number of terms in the Taylor series). It then calculates the value of the function 
log((x−1)/(x+1)) using both the standard logarithmic function and the Taylor series expansion. Afterward, the program compares the results and outputs the difference between the two values.

### Program Flow
1. The program prompts the user to input a value for x and a limit (maximum number of terms in the Taylor series).
2. The program calculates the value of log((x−1)/(x+1)) using the built-in logarithmic function.
3. The program calculates an approximation of this logarithmic value using the Taylor series.
4. The program outputs both values and the difference between them.

### Important Notes:
- The value of x must be greater than 1, as the expression (x−1)/(x+1) is undefined for values of x less than or equal to 1 in the logarithmic function.
- The Taylor series will converge to the exact value as the number of terms increases.

### Program Structure
The program consists of the following parts:

1. Input — The user is prompted to enter a value for x and a limit (maximum number of terms for the Taylor series).
2. Logarithmic Calculation — The exact value of log((x−1)/(x+1)) is computed using the standard logarithmic function.
3. Taylor Series Calculation — The logarithmic value is approximated using the Taylor series expansion.
4. Comparison — The program outputs the difference between the exact and approximate values.

### How to Use
1. Download and save the program to your device.
2. Run the program in a Python interpreter.
3. Enter a value for x (greater than 1) and a limit (an integer that specifies the maximum number of Taylor series terms to be used).
4. The program will output:
- The exact logarithmic value.
- The approximate value using the Taylor series.
- The difference between the two values.
